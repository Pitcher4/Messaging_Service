# Messaging_Service
## Overview
Currently, this program works as a fully functioning messaging system. It can send and receive symetric and assymetrically messages locally using a WiFi router, using RSA and AES. The messages are sent quickly whilst maintaining security. It also logs errors which helps keep the platform quick and secure.

### Security Implications
The platform uses RSA and AES encryption; it works by using a public and private key to encrypt and decrypt data. In addition, avoiding use of the internet allows messages to be sent without risk of "man in the middle" style interception attacks, which can be hard to trace back to attacker. 

## Updates
- Executable file
- Errors logged
