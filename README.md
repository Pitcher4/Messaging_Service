# Messaging_Service
## Current Overview
Currently, this program works as a fully functioning messaging system. It can send and receive messages locally, using a WiFi router.

## Aims and Objectives
When this project is finished, I would like the messages to be hashed and salted, and I would like messages to be sent via the Internet. I would also like to encorperate Rust into this project, to get an excecutable file. I think that all of this will make this program usable and helpful to the public.
